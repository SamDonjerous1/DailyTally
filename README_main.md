Thank you for using the software.
This is a self made accounting software that handles dealers and saree list and also the import/export details and payment details.

## ‚ú® What It Does
The software is made under a personal request from someone i know who owns a small saree printing business and requested me to somehow transfer the accounting and data logging to the computer. Thus is the birth of this software. 

The business involes some dealers that send saree to the business owner for printing purpose. After the work is done, the sarees are shipped back and appropiate charges are allocated against the order that the dealer have to pay. 
Every 6 months, a sheet is exchanged between two parties to tally if the number of items sent and recieved matches the both sheet. So the track of items coming in and going out is kept in log and payment done and due is also kept in log. 

Here the software comes into play by reducing the workload to more than 70% by automating all the tedious hand done calculations and entries to doing everything just in a few clicks. All the calculations and checkings are automatic. No more
overhead. The software even generates clean PDFs that can be printed out easily and given to the respective dealer.
